<h3> <i> "The use of Fourier-domain analyses for unwrapping phase images of low SNR" </i></h3> <br> <br> 

<img src="images/vol82_1.jpg" style="width:190px;height:auto;"  align="right">

An interactive Jupyter Book for the highlighted paper by first author **Nan-kuei Chen** and second author **Pei-Hsin Wu**.





Their [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.27719), featured in the **Magnetic Resonance in Medicine** vol. 82, issue 1 published in July 2019, reports a new postprocessing procedure that uses Fourier‚Äêdomain data analyses to improve the accuracy and reliability of phase unwrapping for MRI data of low SNR.

This short Jupyter Book allows their demo code to be reproducible using **Binder**. The book is interactive inline as well, meaning you can change or run the code on the website without launching a MyBinder session or installing any additonal software nedeed to reproduce code. 

All of the code is contained inside one Jupyter notebook that uses [SoS](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/running.html#content) (Script of Scripts) workflow to enable communication between Julia and Python kernels.


### Interactive figures 
*** 

This last section of the Jupyter notebook is for some of the figures and data from the paper, made interactive using Python's <a href="https://plotly.com/"><b>Plotly</b></a> library. Plotly is a technical computing company headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, that develops online data analytics and visualization tools. Plotly was founded by Alex Johnson, Jack Parmer, Chris Parmer, and Matthew Sundquist. 
<br> <br> 
Plotly provides online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools for individuals and collaboration, as well as scientific graphing libraries for Python, R, MATLAB, Perl, Julia, Arduino, and REST.
