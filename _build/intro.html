<p><h3> <i> "The use of Fourier-domain analyses for unwrapping phase images of low SNR" </i></h3> <br></p>
<p><img src="images/vol82_1.jpg" style="width:190px;height:auto;"  align="right"></p>
<p>An interactive Jupyter Book for the highlighted paper by first author <strong>Nan-kuei Chen</strong> and second author <strong>Pei-Hsin Wu</strong>.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.27719">paper</a>, featured in the <strong>Magnetic Resonance in Medicine</strong> vol. 82, issue 1 published in July 2019, reports a new postprocessing procedure that uses Fourier‚Äêdomain data analyses to improve the accuracy and reliability of phase unwrapping for MRI data of low SNR.</p>
<p>This short Jupyter Book allows their demo code to be reproducible using <strong>Binder</strong>. The book is interactive inline as well, meaning you can change or run the code on the website without launching a MyBinder session or installing any additonal software nedeed to reproduce code.</p>
<p>All of the code is contained inside one Jupyter notebook that uses <a href="https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/running.html#content">SoS</a> (Script of Scripts) workflow to enable communication between Julia and Python kernels.</p>

<p>This last section of the Jupyter notebook is for some of the figures and data from the paper, made interactive using Python's <a href="https://plotly.com/"><b>Plotly</b></a> library. Plotly is a technical computing company headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, that develops online data analytics and visualization tools. Plotly was founded by Alex Johnson, Jack Parmer, Chris Parmer, and Matthew Sundquist. 
<br> <br> 
Plotly provides online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools for individuals and collaboration, as well as scientific graphing libraries for Python, R, MATLAB, Perl, Julia, Arduino, and REST.
